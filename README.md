# Starter kit for [Garth](https://garth.darn.es/)

This is a very simple starting point if you wish to use Garth [as a Jekyll theme gem](https://garth.darn.es/about/#as-a-jekyll-theme) or as a [GitHub Pages remote theme](https://github.com/daviddarnes/garth-kit/tree/remote-theme) (see `remote-theme` branch).
