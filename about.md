My name is Gabin Nshimirimana, I am a passionate and self-driven second year Mathematics and Science student at the University of Queensland (UQ). I love helping others whenever and with what I can. This has helped to enjoy participating in extracurricular activities, where I meet new like-minded people who share a similar drive for success.

I have decided to create this blog so I can share amazing stories about successful people; my personal opinion on different matters of our 21st century society; and I will also be sharing my own quotes. Hopefully I will inspire you through this platform.

For any inquiries, suggestions or even comments, feel free to contact me directly through my email address or mobile phone below.
