My name is Gabin Nshimirimana, I am a passionate and self-driven second year Mathematics and Science student at the University of Queensland (UQ). I love helping others whenever and with what I can. This has helped to enjoy participating in extracurricular activities, where I meet new like-minded people who share a similar drive for success.
