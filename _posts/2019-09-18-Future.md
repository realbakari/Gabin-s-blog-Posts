It's pretty sad to see how the majority of current high school students have become lazy. Yes, it's good for students to have favourite subjects, but this shouldn't be an excuse for students who literally sit in the classroom doing absolutely nothing. There's something wrong going on. I am neither a teacher nor a parent, but I have observed this issue for a while, and I think this is the right time for me to speak about it.
Even though this has been happening, we can all agree that we still have chance to minimise the loss by working together. By that, I mean both parents and schools precisely teachers have to be communicating effectively with each other. We need to nurture these young individuals with so many potentials of becoming anything great from teachers to doctors. In addition, the government’s input is also needed. The school rules and policies must be renovated for the sake of tomorrow’s future.

Let me know your thoughts on this issue.
